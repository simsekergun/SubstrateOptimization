# Substrate Optimization
The notebook uses the adjoint method to design a 1.2-um substrate comprising 10 thin layers with an equal thickness of 120 nm. This is a one-dimensional problem. An infinitely long line source is half wavelength below the substrate and we are trying to maximize the field half wavelength above the substrate. The wavelength of EM waves is 600 nm. The maximum allowed relative electrical permittivity value is 4.0. Using less than 20 iterations, we can come up with a design that can enhance the field at the target point by 7% compared to the starting substrate. 

Conclusion: The Adjoint Method can be applied to 1D problems as well.
